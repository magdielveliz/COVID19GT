View mode to code
=================

The definition of a view mode is split between all of the field instances that
are attached to that bundle. This module creates code that updates all field
instances attached to a given bundle for a specific view mode.
To use visit the mange display page - at the bottom of the page next to the save
button is an export button. Clicking this takes you to the export page with the
code required to update all the display modes for each field instance.
Note this code will only update existing field instances - not create them.
